# recursion
In this project, i practice my recursion skills by first, as warm up, 
implementing the fibonacci sequence in Ruby, both iteratively and recursively,
to better understand the differences between both.

After i got a better grasp on recursion, i challenged myself with implementing
a merge_sort function.
